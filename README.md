# professional_portfolio

The goal of this project will be to create the landing page of a a website I will use as a professional portfolio. This page must inclde a photo of me, contact information and a short autobiography along with a navigation bar that will direct the user to different parts of the page and a section with projects that I can showcase to employers. The projects must have titled images that direct the user to the project via a mouse-click. This page also needs to be web responsive on all devices. I am the sole editor of this project and will be the only one writing code. This project includes an HTML and CSS file along with images used throughout the webpage.
